# Kevlar Laces

## Overview

This project contains a collection of custom `git` subcommands to help
more easily manage parts of the development, release, and assurance
workflows for `git` repositories.

It is so-named as a homage to the idea of trying to provide some defense against
a predictable cavalcade of typical—and not typical—foot-guns.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Prerequisites:

 * git
 * gnupg2

```
sudo apt install git gnupg2
```

### Installation

Clone the `kevlar-laces` repository to wherever you normally keep your
repositories. The install script will create symlinks to that location.
For example purposes, the `~/Repositories` directory is used, but any persistent
location will work.

```
cd ~/Repositories
git clone git@github.com:PolySync/kevlar-laces
cd kevlar-laces
. ./install.sh
```

The above example explicitly runs the install script with a preceding `.`. This
is solely for convenience in the _current_ terminal session, because
`install.sh` may need to modify `$PATH` to include `$HOME/.local/bin`. If you
already have `$HOME/.local/bin` in `$PATH` or you do not need to run the various
kevlar-laces git subcommands in the _current_ terminal session, then
`./install.sh` will suffice.

## Usage

### promote

Usage: `git promote <tag> <release-branch>`

When pull requests get merged into the `devel` development branch and Jenkins
successfully builds it, then it will get auto-tagged with a semver version tag
like `1.1.2-devel.54` when it's time to cut a release one of those tags will
need to be promoted to the release branch.

The `promote` subcommand is intended to be used for promoting a development
branch to release. For instance if your release branch was `master`, and your
development branch tag was `1.1.2-devel.54`, then from inside the project
repository you'd run:

```
git promote 1.1.2-devel.54 master
```

Which would do a signed merge of `devel` at `1.1.2-devel.54` into `master` and
then tag `master` with `1.1.2`, thus creating the `1.1.2` release.

### merge-pr

Usage: `git merge-pr [--no-prune] <src> <dest>`

The web UIs of GitHub and BitBucket don't create signed merge commits, which
creates a problem when trying to measure the validity of a repository. So PRs
need to be merged and pushed outside the web UIs.

The `merge-pr` subcommand is to help make it easier to merge PRs without
interrupting your workflow when working on a project. If the branch requesting
to be merged was `bugfix/fix-all-yo-bugz`, and the destination branch to merge
to is `devel`, then from inside the project repository you'd run:

```
git merge-pr bugfix/fix-all-yo-bugz devel
```

This will result in any changes in your current working tree being stashed, the
remote changes for the repo being fetched, the PR being merged, and your stashed
changes being unstashed so you can keep working.

By default the `merge-pr` subcommand will also prune the requesting branch after
it has been merged. If you want to disable this then call the command with the
`--no-prune` flag like:

```
git merge-pr --no-prune bugfix/fix-all-yo-bugz devel
```

### secure-push

Usage: `git secure-push [<branch> | <local_branch>:<remote_branch> | HEAD]`

Git is vulnerable to metadata attacks as detailed in the [RSL paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_torres-arias.pdf).
In order to create a signed and replicated state log the `git-secure-push` and
`git-secure-fetch`/`git-secure-pull` scripts work in concert to create a
reference state log for branches and tags that can be verified by other
developers to ensure the repository metadata is consistent (or at least the
parts known during the last interaction with the Bitbucket or GitHub server are
unchanged).

The `secure-push` subcommand will only push the specified branch, or else the currently
checked out branch if none is specified. It will also prompt for GPG signatures
twice: first for the clearsign of the current metadata state for this branch,
and second for the commit containing that metadata.  The `secure-push` command
will also create the `rsl` branch if necessary.

```
git secure-push
git secure-push HEAD
git secure-push HEAD:remote_branch
git secure-push local_branch
git secure-push local_branch:remote_branch
```

### secure-fetch

Usage: `git secure-fetch [branch]`

Git is vulnerable to metadata attacks as detailed in the [RSL paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_torres-arias.pdf).
In order to create a signed and replicated state log the `git-secure-push` and
`git-secure-fetch`/`git-secure-pull` scripts work in concert to create a
reference state log for branches and tags that can be verified by other
developers to ensure the repository metadata is consistent (or at least the
parts known during the last interaction with the Bitbucket or GitHub server are
unchanged).

The `secure-fetch` subcommand will only fetch the currently checked out branch. It
will also create a nonce on the `rsl` branch and therefore will prompt for GPG
signature as part of that commit.

The `secure-fetch` subcommand will not merge any changes into the local working
branch. For that you'll either need to use `git merge` explicitly, or use `git
secure-pull`.

```
git secure-fetch
```

### secure-pull

Usage: `git secure-pull [branch]`

Git is vulnerable to metadata attacks as detailed in the [RSL paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_torres-arias.pdf).
In order to create a signed and replicated state log the `git-secure-push` and
`git-secure-fetch`/`git-secure-pull` scripts work in concert to create a
reference state log for branches and tags that can be verified by other
developers to ensure the repository metadata is consistent (or at least the
parts known during the last interaction with the Bitbucket or GitHub server are
unchanged).

The `secure-pull` subcommand will only fetch and merge the currently checked out branch. It
will also create a nonce on the `rsl` branch and therefore will prompt for GPG
signature as part of that commit.

The `secure-pull` subcommand will only attempt to fast-forward merge any upstream
changes and will fail if it is unable to do so. If you need a recursive/3-way
merge, you'll need to explicitly use `git merge`.

```
git secure-pull
```

## Tests

The behavior for each of the tools are specified in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference)
feature files. Each of the Given, When, Then steps for the feature files are
implemented in using [Behave](https://pythonhosted.org/behave/tutorial.html).

The features are laid out according to the expectations of users for this suite
of tools (like `features/unique_error_codes.feature` or
`features/replaces_work_in_progress.feature`) rather than a feature file for
each of the tools in the suite. This encourages a uniform feel across the tool
suite. Individual steps (Given, When, Then) should try to exercise commonality,
but are free to isolate their steps in their own implementation files.

### Test Dependencies

In order to run the tests, you'll need behave, which in turn relies upon python.

```
sudo apt install gnupg2 git python python-pip
pip install behave pyhamcrest
```

### Running Tests

The `Jenkinsfile` specifies how Jenkins will execute the tests; however, you may
(and probably should) run the tests locally using `behave`. The tests must be 
run from within the `tests` directory.
